1. For each disease, I've provided 2 abundance matrices for Health(D006262) and Disease(DXXXXXX), with the same species. 
    This's enough for you to start trying to do classification between Health and each disease using your own model/algorithm
2. And for each abundance matrix, all metadata of the runs(samples) are provided, including Health(D006262). You can see the
    types of information includes Age, Gender, BMI,... Therefore, you can also try some regression model with the matrices. However, you
    need to first filter the samples, only QC = 1 used.
3. Generally in my workflow, I select species with "median.relative.abundance>=0.01". That's why you may see the number of 
    species(columns) in the abundance matrices are fewer than the number in _species files.
4. No need for you to know how to use R, try to intimate my workflow with Python or whatever you're familar with.
